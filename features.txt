Features:
 - Automatically removes any invalid trade requests
 - Able to search for traders and items
 - Messaging between any two users
 - Ratings for any trader
 - Automatic trade suggestions. There are two algorithms we implemented to do this:
        - One algorithm compares wishlist items in your trader with the inventory of any other trader and
          returns a trade if it found two exact matches. This makes it so that all users involved in the trade
          are perfectly happy with the results.
        - The second algorithm also compares wishlist items in your trader with the inventory of any other trader and
          instead returns a trade if it found two similar (not exactly the same) items. This gurantees that the two
          traders in the trade are more or less happy with the results.
 - The ability to change username, password, and city as a trader
 - Password is validated so it has to meet certain requirements (certain length, needs upper case, needs symbol)
 - Idle status, a status that prevents you from trading and makes it so you don’t show up in the system as a trader.
   This can be toggled by the trader without admin approval as long as there are no ongoing trades.
   The idea of this is to go "hidden" in the system so other people know you're inactive.
 - Reports, users can report another user (essentially just sending a message to the admins)
 - Demo user that can’t trade but can use the program like a trader, although none of the buttons that require an account
   actually work (such as sending messages, starting a trade)
 - Every admin can "infiltrade" a trader. This makes them take control of the account, allowing them to perform any actions
   that same trader could do. This gives the admin the ability to undo certain actions taken by the trader.
 - Every admin can undo an ongoing trade.
 - Ability for the admin to adjust settings related to limits in trading
